## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- API keys for:
  - Minimax (M2.1 model)
  - OpenRouter (for Gemini)
  - Exa (web search)

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
cd deep-research-agent
uv sync
```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
```
MINIMAX_API_KEY=your_minimax_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

Then enter your research queries at the prompt.

### Single Query Mode

```bash
uv run python main.py -q "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
```

### Save Report to File

```bash
uv run python main.py -q "AI trends in 2025" --save
```

### Verbose Mode

```bash
uv run python main.py -q "Climate change solutions" --verbose
```

### CLI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-q, --query` | Research query (skips interactive mode) |
| `-s, --save` | Save report to `reports/` folder |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show detailed progress and thinking blocks |

### Interactive Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/save <query>` | Save the report to a file |
| `/verbose <query>` | Show detailed progress |
| `/help` | Show help message |
| `exit`, `quit`, `q` | Exit the program |

---

## How It Works

### 1. Query Planning

The **Planning Agent** decomposes your query into 3-5 optimized subqueries:

```json
{
  "subqueries": [
    {"query": "quantum computing breakthroughs 2025", "type": "news", "priority": 1},
    {"query": "quantum computing applications cryptography", "type": "auto", "priority": 2}
  ]
}
```

### 2. Web Search

The **Web Search Retriever** executes each subquery using Exa:
- Performs neural search for each subquery
- Finds similar content for high-priority results
- Extracts highlights and key information

### 3. Synthesis

The **Supervisor Agent** (Minimax M2.1):
- Maintains reasoning state via interleaved thinking
- Synthesizes comprehensive report with:
  - Table of contents
  - Key takeaways
  - Executive summary
  - Detailed analysis
  - Cited sources

### 4. Interleaved Thinking

The key innovation: the supervisor preserves ALL content blocks (thinking + text + tool_use) in conversation history. This maintains the reasoning chain across multiple turns for more coherent reports.

## Customization

### Adjust Report Style
Edit system prompt in `src/agents/supervisor.py`

### Modify Search Parameters
Edit `src/agents/web_search_retriever.py`:
- `num_results`: Results per query (default: 5-10)
- `time_period`: Date filtering
- `content_type`: Filter by type (news, research, blog)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing API keys | Ensure `.env` exists and has all keys set |
| API errors | Verify keys are valid, check rate limits |
| Import errors | Run `uv sync` and use `uv run python main.py` |

## Performance

- Average query time: **30-60 seconds**
- Factors: number of subqueries (3-5), search complexity, LLM response times

## Report Grounding Auditor

After the supervisor synthesizes a report, a **grounding auditor** runs an
independent pass that checks the report's inline citations and numeric claims
against the sources actually retrieved by the web search retriever, then
appends a `Source Grounding Audit` section to the report flagging anything it
could not trace back to evidence. This surfaces fabricated or unsupported
citations before the report ships.

The auditor is deterministic and parameter-free (citation-URL matching plus
lexical claim overlap), so it runs on every report with no extra API calls.
Adapted from the Auditor agent in *BrainPilot: Automating Brain Discovery
with Agentic Research* (arXiv:2607.15079) — Mode 2 adapted port, where
BrainPilot's curated knowledge base is replaced by this pipeline's retrieved
Exa sources and its LLM fabrication judge by the parameter-free grounding
proxy. Implementation lives in `src/agents/auditor.py`.

---

## Graph of Trace

Alongside the grounding audit, each report carries a **Graph of Trace** — an
auditable record of the workflow that produced it. As the supervisor runs, it
records the research subgoal, every `planning_agent` / `web_search_retriever`
tool call, the evidence each call returned, and the final synthesized report,
then appends a `## Graph of Trace` section rendering those steps as a linked
tree. This lets a reader follow and inspect exactly how a result was reached.

The recorder is deterministic and parameter-free (it captures tool names,
inputs, source counts, and citation counts the supervisor already has), so it
adds no API calls and complements the grounding auditor: the trace shows *how*
the report was built, the auditor checks *whether* its claims are grounded.

with Agentic Research* (arXiv:2607.15079) — Mode 2 adapted port, where
BrainPilot's full graph over PI and specialist agents is replaced by a per-step
trace over this pipeline's own agents. Implementation lives in
`src/agents/research_trace.py`.
